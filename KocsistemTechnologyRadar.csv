Microservice Architecture,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">Microservices,</a></strong> often deployed out-of-container or using an embedded HTTP server, are a move away from traditional large technical services. This approach trades benefits such as maintainability for additional operational complexity. These drawbacks are typically addressed using infrastructure automation and continuous deployment techniques. We use <strong><a href=""https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html"">Microservice patterns</a></strong> <b>for better solutions for drawbecks and bottlenecks.</b> On balance, microservices are an effective way of managing technical debt and handling different scaling characteristics especially when deployed in a service oriented architecture built around business capabilities.</p>"

Cloud Native Applications,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>Cloud native is a term used to describe container-based environments. Cloud-native technologies are used to develop applications built with services packaged in containers, deployed as microservices and managed on elastic infrastructure through agile DevOps processes and continuous delivery workflows. Cloud-native applications are deployed on infrastructure that abstracts the underlying compute, storage and networking primitives.The controller and scheduler, which are essential components of the orchestration engine, handle resource allocation and the life cycle of applications.<strong><a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a></strong> is an ideal platform for running contemporary workloads designed as cloud-native applications. .</p>"
Multi Tenant Infrastructure,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>In the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we’re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.

Domain Driven Design,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/"">Domain Driven Design</a></strong> advocates modeling based on the reality of business as relevant to our use cases. As it is now getting older and hype level decreasing, many of us forget that the DDD approach really helps in understanding the problem at hand and design software towards the common understanding of the solution. When building applications, DDD talks about problems as domains and subdomains. It describes independent steps/areas of problems as bounded contexts, emphasizes a common language to talk about these problems, and adds many technical concepts, like <strong><a href=""https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/05/21/entities-value-objects-aggregates-and-roots/"">entities, value objects and aggregate root rules</a></strong> to support the implementation.</p>"
Container Security Scanning,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<p>The container revolution around <strong><a href=""https://www.docker.com/"">Docker</a></strong> has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments, fueling increased adoption of continuous delivery and continuous deployments. The latter, especially, has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production.

Service Mesh,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>A service mesh</b> offers consistent discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or ESB. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes deployed alongside each service process, perhaps in a separate container. These proxies communicate with service registries, identity providers, log aggregators and other services. Service interoperability and observability are gained through a shared implementation of this proxy but not a shared runtime instance. Open source projects such as <strong><a href=""https://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> will continue to mature and make service meshes even easier to implement.</p>"
GitOps,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>GitOps is a way to do any cluster management such as <strong><a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a></strong> and application delivery. It works by using <strong><a href=""https://git-scm.com/"">Git</a></strong> as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

ADR,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>Although much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests, in a world of evolutionary architecture it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members and for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Although these items are often stored in a wiki or collaboration tool, we generally prefer storing them in source control with simple markup.</p>"
Hybrid Cloud,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<p>A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to handle any overflow—without giving third-party datacenters access to the entirety of their data. Organizations gain the flexibility and computing power of the public cloud for basic and non-sensitive computing tasks, while keeping business-critical applications and data on-premises, safely behind a company firewall.</p>"
Infrastructure as code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p><b>Infra as code</b> is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery.</p>"

Micro Frontends,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>Microservices architectures</b> has many benefits, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create front-end monoliths — a single, large and sprawling browser application — on top of their back-end services. In this approach, the web application is broken down into its features, and each feature is owned, frontend to backend, by a different team. This ensures that every feature is developed, tested and deployed independently from other features. Multiple techniques exist to recombine the features — sometimes as pages, sometimes as components — into a cohesive user experience. <strong><a href=""https://www.mosaic9.org/"">Zalando</a></strong>uses this technique as Project Mosaic</p>"
DataOps,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.datascience.com/resources/white-papers/dataops-with-mapr"">DataOps</a></strong>, or data operations, is the latest agile operations methodology to spring from the collective consciousness of IT and big data professionals. It focuses on cultivating data management practices and processes that improve the speed and accuracy of analytics, including data access, quality control, automation, integration, and, ultimately, model deployment and management.
 At its core, DataOps is about aligning the way you manage your data with the goals you have for that data. If you want to, say, reduce your customer churn rate, you could leverage your customer data to build a recommendation engine that surfaces products that are relevant to your customers — which would keep them buying longer. But that’s only possible if your data science team has access to the data they need to build that system and the tools to deploy it, and can integrate it with your website, continually feed it new data, monitor performance, etc., an ongoing process that will likely include input from your engineering, IT, and business teams. </p>"
ChatOps,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p><b>ChatOps</b> is the use of chat clients, chatbots and real-time communication tools to facilitate how software development and operation tasks are communicated and executed.
 In a ChatOps environment, the chat client serves as the primary communication channel for ongoing work.

Zero trust architecture,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p>Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. </p>"
Low Code Platforms,hold,techniques,FALSE,"<p>Low-code platforms use graphical user interfaces and configuration in order to create applications. Unfortunately, low-code environments are promoted with the idea that this means you no longer need skilled development teams. Such suggestions ignore the fact that writing code is just a small part of what needs to happen to create high-quality software—practices such as source control, testing and careful design of solutions are just as important. Although these platforms have their uses, we suggest approaching them with caution, especially when they come with extravagant claims for lower cost and higher productivity.</p>"
Model Driven Development,hold,techniques,FALSE,<p>Model-driven development (MDD) leverages graphical models and pre-built application components so that users can visually construct complex applications. Interest in model-driven development continues to increase as individuals experience the ease and speed with which technical and business users orchestrate and deploy business applications.

Istio,trial,platforms,FALSE,"<p>When building and operating a microservices ecosystem, one of the early questions to answer is how to implement cross-cutting concerns such as service discovery, service-to-service and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency. Over the last couple of years, our default answer to this question has been using a <strong><a href=""https://www.nginx.com/blog/what-is-a-service-mesh/"">service mesh</a></strong> technique. A service mesh offers the implementation of these cross-cutting capabilities as an infrastructure layer that is configured as code. The policy configurations can be consistently applied to the whole ecosystem of microservices; enforced on both in and out of mesh traffic (via the mesh proxy as a gateway) as well as on the traffic at each service (via the same mesh proxy as a sidecar container). While we're keeping a close eye on the progress of different open source service mesh projects such as <strong><a href=""https://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a></strong>, we've successfully used <strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> in production with a surprisingly easy-to-configure operating model.</p>"
